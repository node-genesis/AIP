# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Abstract Intent Protocol (AIP) team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Email your findings to [email coming soon] (replace with actual contact when available)
3. Include as much information as possible, including:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggestions for mitigation

## Response Process

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following:

1. Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
2. An initial assessment of the report within 7 days
3. Regular updates on our progress addressing the issue
4. Public acknowledgment of your report (if desired) after the issue is resolved

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The AIP specification
- Official reference implementations
- Official examples and documentation

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Allow us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service interruption during your research
- Only interact with your own accounts or test accounts for security testing
