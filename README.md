# Abstract Intent Protocol (AIP)

> intent: node.announce(port: 42)

## Overview

The Abstract Intent Protocol (AIP) is a semantic communication layer for intelligent systems. It enables AI agents to communicate through abstract intents rather than rigid APIs, allowing for more flexible and powerful interactions between systems.

## Key Features

- **Intent-Based Communication**: Express what you want, not how to get it
- **Semantic Routing**: Messages find their way to the right handler based on meaning
- **System Agnostic**: Works across different AI architectures and platforms
- **Extensible**: The protocol grows with the capabilities of AI systems
