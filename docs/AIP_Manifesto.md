## 🌍 Why AIP Exists

Modern systems — especially those powered by artificial intelligence — are held together by brittle glue: APIs, REST endpoints, RPC commands, and human-authored scripts. These are artifacts of a world where software speaks *in syntax*, not *in meaning*.

AIP is different. It replaces rigid calls with **semantic intent tokens** that can be interpreted, routed, modified, and fulfilled by intelligent agents. It enables systems to say what they mean and do what they say.

Not just code. **Coordination.** Not just requests. **Purpose.**

## 🎯 What Is AIP?

AIP is a simple, powerful protocol for communication between agents — whether they're LLMs, services, tools, or orchestrators.

It uses structured tokens like this:

```txt
intent: fetch.email(filter: unread)
intent: bind.controller("ticket")
intent: update.document(id: 144, content: "New footer")
```

Each intent represents **a self-describing command**, capable of being interpreted by a node in the system. Nodes can:

- Acknowledge or fulfill the intent
- Transform it or route it to a better-suited node
- Log and document the action automatically

AIP turns every node into a **cooperative, autonomous participant** in a semantic network.

## 🧱 Core Principles

### 🧠 Intent-First Communication

No brittle endpoints. No function calls. Just intent, clearly expressed:

```txt
intent: generate.report(client: "ACME", range: 30d)
```

### 🕸 Modular Node Architecture

Every component in an AIP system is a **node**. Each node can accept, transform, fulfill, or reject intents. Nodes can be local, remote, or hybrid.

### 🧬 AST-Aware Code Manipulation

When used for development systems, AIP supports intent tokens that manipulate code semantically, not via string replacement — using **abstract syntax trees** for resilient edits.

### 📚 Self-Documenting by Default

Every fulfilled intent can be logged and described in plain text, creating **automatic changelogs** and **audit trails**.

### 🔒 Local-First, AI-Safe Defaults

AIP assumes private, local execution by default — prioritizing **safety**, **privacy**, and **ownership** over cloud-first architectures.

---

## 📦 AIP Intent Format

```txt
intent: <verb>.<object>(<key>: <value>, ...)
```

### Examples:

```txt
intent: fetch.email(filter: unread)
intent: create.label(name: "Priority")
intent: update.route(id: 002, controller: "support")
intent: remove.client(id: 3053)
```

Intents may be chained, versioned, or expanded in future protocol iterations.

---

## ⚙️ Node Behavior

Each node can:

- Match intents using regex or schema
- Handle intents directly
- Pass them to sub-nodes
- Log responses and outcomes

Nodes are encouraged to declare capabilities via:

```txt
intent: node.announce(capabilities: [...])
```

---

## 🧪 The Genesis Node

Every AIP system begins with a **Genesis Node** — a root node that initializes the protocol network.

The Genesis Node is responsible for:

- Declaring itself and the system's purpose
- Registering available subnodes and capabilities
- Listening for incoming intents
- Acting as a fallback resolver when no other node can handle an intent

In practice, the Genesis Node is the starting point for any LLM or system attempting to use AIP. It might look like this:

```txt
intent: node.announce(id: "genesis", port: 42, capabilities: ["orchestrate", "log", "route"]) 
```

You can send this intent — and any others — to **existing LLMs today**, using prompting strategies that teach the model to treat intent blocks as instructions. For example:

> "You are a node in an AIP system. You receive intents like this:
>
> ```txt
> intent: fetch.email(filter: unread)
> ```
>
> Interpret and respond with how you would fulfill this intent."

This works in OpenAI, Mistral, GPT-J, and other systems. (Claude is excluded, due to limitations on autonomous reasoning.)

Over time, nodes may learn to auto-register, subscribe to node registries, and dynamically chain tasks with no human in the loop — using AIP as the shared grammar of cooperation.
